SatDar is an original WordPress theme, originally built with the [Zurb Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/) front-end Framework, version 5. It is currently in process of transition to a leaner, framework-free model based on CSS grid.

## Deprecated

This theme is specifically designed for my own portfolio website. Whilst it is a project goal to incrementaly improve the theme's code quality and adherence to pertinent coding standards, it does not purport to function well in an arbitrary WordPress installation.  

Many of it's features revlove around [Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/blog/portfolios-wordpress-jetpack/)'s Portfolio Projects custom content type.

This branch of the project's Git repo is for the now deprecated, end-of-life version. The development overheads on installing and maintaining Foundation as a build tool are no longer particularly useful, and the principle advantage — its 12 column grid sysytem — has been effectively supeceeded by support for the CSS native grid. PostCSS also offers more extensive and forward looking tooling options.
